# Gunner PyGame
Hello, 

This is my first post on GitHub and I figured I would post something fun. 

This is a simple python game using some basic assets from itch.io. I DO NOT own the assets used in this game. The credits for the assets will be featured below this description. 

The concept of the game is simple, the player can freely move across the screen to shoot down aliens spawning from the opposite side 
of the screen every second to score as many points as they possibly can before colliding with one. 

To start the game, simply hit the SPACEBAR key. And to restart the game, hit the ENTER key and the SPACEBAR to begin again.

To control the Gunner, use the A and D keys to move left and right. The SPACEBAR can also be used to jump up and down.
